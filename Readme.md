# AlphaFold2-ColabFold Tutorial

This repository hosts the AlphaFold2-ColabFold Tutorial, designed to guide you through the process of using the powerful AlphaFold2 within Google Colab's cloud-based environment. This tutorial serves as a follow-up to the previous RosettaCM tutorial, revisiting the modeling of the dopamine 3 receptor (D3R) in a new, more advanced setting.

No prior knowledge of AlphaFold2, Google Colab, or protein structure prediction is required. You can run, modify, and see the corresponding results of the code in real-time with an interactive learning experience.
